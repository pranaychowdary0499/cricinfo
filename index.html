<h2>Gurney to miss IPL, T20 Blast due to shoulder injury</h2>
<div class="s1">
<p><font size="4">Harry Gurney, the Nottinghamshire paceman, will miss the Indian Premier League 2020 along with the Vitality Blast due to a shoulder injury. The left-arm seamer, who has 190 wickets in T20s, will undergo surgery in September.</p>
<p>"Having gone through the same frustrations as everyone this year in waiting for cricket to restart, I'm devastated to have to miss the Blast," he said. "Some of the proudest moments in my career have been with Notts, and nothing quite compares to being out on the field at Trent Bridge competing for trophies with some of my best mates. To have that taken away for a year is tough.</p>
<p>"I have a huge amount of faith in the squad of players and in their ability to go deep in the tournament. I'll be cheering them on for sure, and will be there with a word of advice or tactical input whenever it's needed," he added.</p>
<p>Gurney was Notts Outlaws' highest wicket-taker in the T20 Blast last year, ending up with 22 scalps at 18. "Harry would improve any T20 side in the world, so it's a blow to lose him for this year's tournament," said Head Coach Peter Moores. "With the experience and expertise he's gained from a global white-ball career, he's become a real leader in our limited-overs dressing room.</p>
<p>"What I always say in these situations is that - whilst we are all gutted for Harry - it does provide someone else with an opportunity and that can be exciting. There are a number of talented bowlers in our squad who are looking to take their next steps forward in the white-ball game - and there are some experienced men, like Luke Fletcher and Jake Ball, who will be very keen to take on extra responsibility," he added.</p>

<p>England and Australia players could be available for the whole season of IPL 2020 without having to undergo a quarantine period upon their arrival in the UAE. Addressing a virtual press conference, RCB chairman Sanjeev Churiwala said that given the England and Australia players will have been part of a bio-secure bubble during the limited-overs series in the UK, there is a likelihood negative COVID tests will enable them to partake in the tournament. A final decision on the matter, however, will be taken post discussion with BCCI.
</p>
<p>Churiwala said that Australian players, including captain and new RCB acquisition Aaron Finch, will land in the UAE on September 17, a day after the last T20I game in Manchester. They will be chartered to the UAE and tested thoroughly upon arrival. It is understood that if the players and staff have not stepped out of the bubble through their emigration process from the UK and have tested negative upon arrival, it is unlikely they will need another week of quarantine before featuring in the games.
</p>
<p>Besides Finch, RCB have Kane Richardson and Joshua Phillipe featuring in the tournament in the UK while Moeen Ali is likely to be involved for England.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Churiwala also stated that South African players in the team - AB de Villiers, Chris Morris and Dale Steyn - will reach UAE on Saturday (August 22), a day after the Indian players land, while Sri Lankan all-rounder Isuru Udana will join the team on September 1.

<p>Shimron Hetmyer continued to soar in his flying start to the Caribbean Premier League, as he followed up his 63 off 44 on the opening day with a 44-ball 71 on just the second as Guyana Amazon Warriors opened their account for the season. Hetmyer's effort came after Keemo Paul (4 for 19) and Imran Tahir (2 for 18) swept the carpet from under St. Kitts and Nevis Patriots' feet, restricting them to just 127 for 8 in their 20 overs.
</p>
<p>Chris Lynn and Evin Lewis's slow and cautious start gave away that the Trinidad pitch had a bit of sluggishness to it, and Chris Green - who put the Patriots in to bat first - took early advantage of it. If the two-pacedness wasn't enough, Green brought on Imran Tahir early on to unsettle the big-hitting Aussie who has often shown susceptibility to spin bowling. The move worked like a charm as the leggie lured Lynn to chase after a ball bowled outside off-stump and going further away from the right-hander.
</p>
<p>Lynn's attempt to smash it over the off-side field was futile as Green took a regulation catch at mid-off. Though Lewis shook off the early pressure in Naveen-ul-Haq's 18-run over, Nicholas Pooran's sharp glovework behind the stumps ended the resurgence quickly.
</p>
<p>The batting side still had enough to call it a good start - 54 for 2 in 6 overs - but Paul stepped in to puncture any hopes of consolidation. The Patriots went from 53 for 2 to 83 for 5, and needed a 28-run alliance between Ben Dunk and Rayad Emrit to salvage something from the first half of the fixture. Paul broke that stand too, and finished with a four-fer, leaving Patriots to defend a sub-par total of 127 for 8.
</p>
<p>Sheldon Cottrell put the bowling side on the right path early on with Brandon King's early dismissal, but Hetmyer turned a slow start into a solid one, courtesy Rayad Emrit's 17-run over. The pitch still had something in it for the bowlers to keep them in the reckoning. Chandrapaul Hemraj's dismissal following a run-a-ball 19 gave them an opening, but Hetmyer stood firm in the way of a batting collapse.
</p>
<p>He took it upon himself to steer his team away from trouble, starting by scoring the bulk of the runs in a 37-run third-wicket partnership with Ross Taylor during which he reached his second successive half-century. It took a bit of yes-no miscommunication between the two to let the Patriots back in the game when Taylor was sent packing - run out in the 13th over.
</p>
<p>Brief Scores: Guyana Amazon Warriors 131/7 in 17 overs (Shimron Hetmyer 71; Rayad Emrit 3-31) beat St. Kitts & Nevis Patriots 127/8 in 20 overs (Evin Lewis 30; Keemo Paul 4-19, Imran Tahir 2-18) by 3 wickets
